    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>  Carbonara description as per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonara">wikipedia</a>: Carbonara
         (Italian: [karboˈnaːra]) is an Italian
         pasta dish from Rome made with eggs,
         hard cheese, cured pork and black 
         pepper. The dish arrived at its 
         modern form, with its current name,
         in the middle of the 20th century. </p>

    <p> The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano,
        Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination 
        of the two. Spaghetti is the most
        common pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni,
         linguine, or bucatini are also used.
        Normally guanciale or pancetta are used
         for the meat component, but lardons
        of smoked bacon are a common substitute
        outside Italy. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Let's Start</strong> - Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li><strong>Moving on</strong> - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>To Finish</strong> - Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale. Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
    </ol>

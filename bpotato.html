    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 large baking potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ cup leftover gravy</li>
        <li>½ cup cream cheese</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped cooked turkey</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped leftover stuffing</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Let's Start</strong> - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place potatoes on a baking sheet; rub with canola oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Moving on</strong> - Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a knife, about 1 hour. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>The potatoes</strong> - Cut potatoes in half lengthwise. Scrape flesh into the bowl of a stand mixer, being careful not to tear the skin. Leave a small rim of flesh in the skin intact. Place hollowed-out potato skins back on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>The Filling</strong> - Beat butter, gravy, cream cheese, salt, and pepper into the potato flesh on low speed. Add 1 cup Cheddar cheese; mix for a few seconds. Remove bowl from the stand mixer; fold in turkey, stuffing, and green onions using a spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Putting it all together</strong> - Fill potato skins with the mixture. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Return to the oven</strong> - bake until warmed through, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
